        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>he creamiest and dreamiest pasta you will ever taste. This authentic italian recipe from Northern italy was popularized by the great italian chef Massimo Bottura. He was able to make this dish an italian staple after an earthquake ocurred in the Emilio romagnia region of italy. This earthquake caused an immense damage in the infrastructure of storing one of italy's most expensive cheeses, the parmeggiano reggiano. Due to this problem he decided to popularize this recipe which combined this incredible 48 month-aged cheese with pecorino romano and black pepper which results in this masterpiece of italian cuisine. </p>

       <p> Even though this recipe only contains a few ingredients, it is still a very technical dish. Over heating or lack of water to bind the ingredients together and emulsify them can cause a big nasty mess. That is why it is very important to follow the recipe correctly and finally, enjoy this wonderful dish. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>400 g spaghetti
        <li>1 tbsp black pepper (grains)</li>

        <li>100 g parmeggiano reggiano cheese</li>
        <li> pinch salt</li>
        <li>pasta water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions </h2>
   <p> First grate the pecorino and parmeggiano. Then bring water to a boil in a pot. Once the boiling point is reached, salt the water well and cook the spaghetti al dente according to package instructions.</p>
   <p>In the meantime, place the grains of pepper in a mortar and crush them with a pestle. This gives the pepper more spiciness. Now put the crushed pepper in a large frying pan and roast it over low heat. Then deglaze with a shot of pasta water.</p>
   <p>Now add 4 to 5 more ladlefuls of pasta water to a bowl and set aside</p>
   <p>Drain the spaghetti in a colander as soon as they are al dente. Then add about â…“ of the pasta to the frying pan with the roasted pepper. Stir everything thoroughly with pasta tongs and add a little pasta water as needed. </p>
   <p>Meanwhile, put half of the grated pecorino in a bowl and add a ladleful of pasta water. Mix vigorously with a whisk. Then add the remaining pecorino and again a little pasta water and mix again until a nice cream is formed.</p>
   <p>Now add the remaining spaghetti to the frying pan and turn off the heat. Pour the pecorino cream on top, season with salt and mix everything thoroughly.</p>
   <p>Then arrange the delicious pasta on deep plates, sprinkle with more grated pecorino if desired and enjoy.</p>
